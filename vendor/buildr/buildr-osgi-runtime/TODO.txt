* Make it possible for containers and features to include files in the
  distribution. These files would be rake tasks them selves and thus
  regenerated when dependencies require them to be regenerated and could
  be included in the packages at specified locations.
  - containers can define config files and shell scripts to start container
  - features can include configuration files (i.e. loggger can include
    java.util.logging.properties)

* Make it possible for system_settings and parameters to be documented in
  generated config files. Will need to define appropriate description methods
  that store it along side values

* Update felix container so it works in the correct format

* Move the generation of zip into plugin

* Make the generation of dir from same layout as zip possible

* Add feature for EasyEJB

* Add feature for Hibernate 3.5.1
